Box Office Revenue Prediction
This project is a machine learning application that predicts the box office revenue of a movie based on key attributes such as budget, popularity, runtime, release status, release year, genres, keywords, and cast members. The model is designed to assist in evaluating a movie's potential revenue using input parameters commonly known before the release of the movie.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the potential box office revenue for a movie based on various pre-release attributes. Given the high uncertainty in predicting movie revenue due to diverse audience tastes and external factors, this model aims to provide an approximate forecast by learning patterns from historical data.

Features
Budget: The production cost of the movie in millions of dollars.
Popularity: A numerical score representing the movie's popularity, derived from historical data.
Runtime: The length of the movie in minutes.
Status: The production status of the movie (e.g., "Released", "Post Production").
Release Year: The year the movie was or is expected to be released.
Genres: List of genres (e.g., "Horror", "Comedy", "Action") associated with the movie.
Keywords: Important keywords that describe the movie (e.g., "duty", "love", "revenge").
Cast: List of key cast members in the movie (e.g., "Brad Pitt", "Scarlett Johansson").
Data Requirements
The model requires a dataset with historical information on movies, including budget, popularity, runtime, release status, release year, genres, keywords, cast, and the actual box office revenue as the target variable. The data is preprocessed to handle categorical variables and scaled for better model performance.

Model Training
The prediction model is built using machine learning algorithms, such as:

Linear Regression
XGB Regressor

The model is trained using a dataset of movies with known box office revenues, with features preprocessed to handle categorical data like genres, keywords, and cast by applying techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or embeddings.


Prediction Usage
To make predictions, users input relevant movie data, and the trained model outputs an estimated box office revenue.
